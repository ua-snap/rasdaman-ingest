# CMIP6 Indicator Rasdaman Ingest

## Clone Github repository onto your user directory on Rasdaman server

Clone the Github repository in a place with lots of storage.

`cd /opt/rasdaman/user_data/<your_username> && git clone https://github.com/ua-snap/rasdaman-ingest.git`

## Generating the CMIP6 Indicators NetCDF file

All of the data needed to generate the single NetCDF file exists on Poseidon at: `/workspace/Shared/Tech_Projects/CMIP_Indicators/`. Move the data into a faster storage medium such as your storage space in the user_data in `/opt/rasdaman/` using the collect.sh file.

`bash ./collect.sh /workspace/Shared/Tech_Projects/CMIP6_Indicators /opt/rasdaman/user_data/<your_username>/rasdaman-ingest/ardac/cmip6_indicators/`

Once the data is in place, we will run the merge script to generate the single NetCDF file containing the historical and projected CMIP6 climate indicators.

`python merge.py`

This generates a set of files called cmip6_indicators_historical.nc (Historical), cmip6_indicators_projected.nc (Projected), and cmip6_indicators.nc (Both).

Finally, we need to strip the int64 values that are generated by Xarray in Python:

`ncap2 -s 'year=int(year); dw=int(dw); ftc=int(ftc); su=int(su);' cmip6_indicators.nc cmip6_indicators_updated.nc`

## Running the ingest

Now we can run the ingest on the Rasdaman server using the ingest.json file.

First, we need to set a environment variable for LUTS_PATH:

`export LUTS_PATH=/opt/rasdaman/user_data/<your_username>/rasdaman-ingest/ardac/cmip6_indicators/luts.py`

Finally, ingest the data:

`/opt/rasdaman/bin/wcst_import.sh -c 0 ingest.json`
