# Sea Ice Indicators

This ingest is for the "sea ice indicators" dataset that was developed by Kyle Redilla (from legacy code developed by Mike Lindgren) based on an algorithm created by Hajo Eicken, Mark Johnson, and John Walsh. The indicators developed and available in this dataset are julian date-valued: days-of-year of freeze-up start and end, and breakup start and end. 

We detailed the development of the algorithm and analysis of its application to ice concentrations derived from satellite imagery [in this paper](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4617-2022). The implementation of this algorithm can be found at [https://github.com/ua-snap/seaice_noaa_indicators](https://github.com/ua-snap/seaice_noaa_indicators).
