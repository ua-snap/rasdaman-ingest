# Archived ingests

This folder contains some ingest files that are no longer used (and are not longer expected to be used) in our production rasdaman instance. It will serve as a repository of valid "ingests" (ingredients files + preprocessing code + helper files) that may be worthy of keeping around in an easily accessible manner because they 1) may be useful to SNAP again one day, or 2) represent a unique solution to one or more ingest problems which makes them valuable to SNAP given the sparse nature of the literature on rasdaman usage.
